  abstract      = {We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that
                   models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and
                   semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to
                   model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states
                   of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large
                   text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing
                   models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging
                   NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment
                   analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals
                   of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix
                   different types of semi-supervision signals.},

  abstract      = {Interpretability in machine learning (ML) is crucial for high stakes decisions and troubleshooting. In this work, we provide fundamental principles for interpretable ML, and dispel 
                    common misunderstandings that dilute the importance of this crucial topic. We also identify
                    10 technical challenge areas in interpretable machine learning and provide history and background on each problem. Some of these problems are classically important, and some are
                    recent problems that have arisen in the last few years. These problems are: (1) Optimizing
                    sparse logical models such as decision trees; (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing
                    constraints into generalized additive models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability;
                    (4) Modern case-based reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data
                    visualization; (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative
                    or causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the “Rashomon set” of good models; and (10)
                    Interpretable reinforcement learning. This survey is suitable as a starting point for statisticians
                    and computer scientists interested in working in interpretable machine learning},
