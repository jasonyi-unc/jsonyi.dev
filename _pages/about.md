I'm Jason Yi, and I work with Full-Stack Development in the Account Opening team at Fidelity Investments using GraphQL and Angular. I'm a rising junior at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu) double majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and Statistics and Analytics (B.S.)

I was an Undergaduate TA for COMP 210 (Data Structures) in Java during 2023-2024 and now a TA for COMP 211 (System Fundamentals) in C.

My interests lie in low-latency development, operating systems, machine learning, and algorithms. I am currently reading [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://beefnoodles.cc/assets/book/C++%20Concurrency%20in%20Action.pdf) and listening to podcasts like [Signals and Threads](https://signalsandthreads.com/) by Jane Street. I'm always happy to have a conversation about these topics to gain new perspectives.

Please reach me at jasonyi [at] unc [dot] edu to chat or collaborate!
